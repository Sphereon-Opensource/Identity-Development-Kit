/**
 * Per-tenant durable registry of OAuth2 AS signing keys with rotation lifecycle.
 *
 * Replaces the single-key-by-alias seam that the early IDK shipped: the AS now tracks one or
 * more keys per tenant in a state machine ([OAuth2SigningKeyState]: `ACTIVE` / `LEGACY` /
 * `DISABLED`) so a key rotation can introduce a new signer without invalidating in-flight
 * tokens. A tenant may have one active signer per algorithm. JWKS publishes both `ACTIVE` and
 * `LEGACY` keys; signatures without an algorithm preference use the highest-priority `ACTIVE`
 * key; verification by `kid` succeeds against any non-disabled entry.
 *
 * **The store itself never holds private key bytes.** Each [OAuth2SigningKey] carries a
 * [com.sphereon.crypto.core.KeyInfo] reference (`kid`, `alias`, `providerId`, algorithm
 * metadata); the actual bytes live where the deployment puts them — software keystore in dev,
 * AWS KMS / Azure Key Vault / HashiCorp Vault Transit in production. A DB compromise of this
 * store leaks the kid catalog and the rotation timestamps; it does NOT leak signing material.
 *
 * Tenancy: every method takes a `tenantId` so a multi-tenant deployment partitions keys per
 * realm. Single-tenant deployments pass a fixed default (typically `"default"`).
 *
 * Implementations live downstream: an in-memory implementation ships in
 * `oauth2-server-authorization-impl` for IDK consumers and tests; a Postgres-backed impl ships
 * in EDK (`vdx/edk/lib/oauth2/server/authorization/store-postgres/`) for production.
