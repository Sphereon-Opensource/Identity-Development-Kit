/**
 * Canonical public-asset path constants for the tenant asset library, shared between the IDK
 * impl layer (which builds the URI returned from [TenantAssetService.uploadAsset]) and the EDK
 * rest hosting adapter (which mounts the public GET endpoints under the same root).
 *
 * Tenant asset URLs are tenant scoped and host independent:
 *
 * ```
 * /public/assets/{tenantId}/{namespace}/{hash}.{ext}
 * ```
 *
 * Because the tenant id is in the path, the URL resolves identically whether assets are served
 * from the tenant's own domain or from the platform domain. The asset id is the SHA-256 content
 * hash and is stable across hosts and re-uploads of the same bytes, hence the deliberately
 * UNVERSIONED `/public/` prefix.
 *
 * Credential design keeps its own `/public/assets/design/{hash}.{ext}` scheme
 * (`PublicDesignAssetPaths`): those URLs are embedded in issued credentials and must stay
 * byte-stable.
