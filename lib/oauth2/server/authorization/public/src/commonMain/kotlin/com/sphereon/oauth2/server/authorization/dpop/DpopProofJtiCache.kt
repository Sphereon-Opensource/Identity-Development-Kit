/**
 * Replay-protection cache for DPoP proof JWT `jti` claims observed at the OAuth2 authorization
 * server (token endpoint, PAR endpoint). RFC 9449 §11.1 SHOULD: track jti values for the proof
 * iat tolerance window so a captured proof cannot be replayed before its `iat` ages out.
 *
 * Implementations must be thread-safe and free expired entries on read so memory stays bounded.
 *
 * Distinct from `com.sphereon.oauth2.server.resource.cache.DpopNonceCache` (resource-server side)
 * to keep the authorization-server impl module independent of the resource-server impl module.
 *
 * **Tenancy partitioning contract**:
 *
 * IDK ships an in-memory implementation that is single-tenant: all observed `jti` values share
 * one keyspace. Implementations backing a multi-tenant deployment MUST partition the `jti`
 * keyspace by tenant so that tenant A cannot block tenant B from accepting a proof that happens
 * to use the same `jti`, nor confirm replay of a proof tenant B has not yet seen. EDK durable
 * implementations (Redis, SQL, Caffeine-with-namespacing, etc.) are responsible for this
 * partitioning, typically via a tenant-prefixed cache key or a per-tenant table partition.
 * Failing to partition lets a hostile tenant pre-poison `jti` values to block legitimate proofs
 * on other tenants.
