/**
 * The single durable store for an authorization server's OAuth2 clients, whether they arrived
 * through dynamic registration (RFC 7591 / RFC 7592) or through an administration surface.
 *
 * This is the persistence seam BEHIND [ClientRegistry], not a second registry: runtime client
 * lookups keep flowing through the single `ClientRegistry` binding, whose implementation
 * overlays configured (`oauth2.clients.*` family) clients on top of whatever this store holds.
 * The volatile in-process map that dynamic registrations used to live in survives restarts
 * only as long as the process does, which made device-flow enrollment (RFC 8628) unusable for
 * provisioned infrastructure clients such as hand-off screens; implementations of this store
 * remove that gap. An in-memory default ships in `oauth2-server-authorization-impl`; EDK ships
 * a Postgres-backed implementation in `vdx/edk/lib/oauth2/server/authorization/store-postgres/`
 * that swaps in via `replaces` when the module is on the classpath.
 *
 * Tenancy: every method takes a `tenantId`, mirroring [SigningKeyStore]. Single-tenant
 * deployments pass a fixed default (typically `"default"`).
 *
 * Secrets: plaintext client secrets are NEVER persisted. The register/update caller hashes the
 * secret with the deployment's verifier and hands only the hash to [save]; verification happens
 * through `ClientRegistry.verifyClientCredentials`. Public clients (device-flow screens) carry
 * a null hash.
 *
 * No contentRevision: the request-scoped configured-client memoization re-resolves every
 * inbound session, so unlike [SigningKeyStore] there is no AppScope snapshot that would need an
 * atomically advanced collection revision. Add one alongside an AppScope cache if one ever
 * reads this store.
